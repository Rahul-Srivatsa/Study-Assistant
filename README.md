The Study Assistant is a novel technological solution designed to address the common issue of student distraction during study sessions, with particular emphasis on children with ADHD.
This study provides an extensive analysis of the development, functionality, and potential impact of the Study Assistant on student motivation and productivity.
The Study Assistant leverages advanced facial and eye detection algorithms to monitor students' behavior during study sessions. By accurately identifying instances of closed eyes or signs of disengagement, the system promptly issues alerts and reminders, facilitating the maintenance of focus. Additionally, the assistant incorporates reminders for sedentary breaks and hydration, fostering healthy study habits and mitigating the effects of fatigue.
This research paper presents a comprehensive examination of the seamless integration of the Study Assistant prototype, utilizing Raspberry Pi and an array of hardware components. It delves into the implementation of facial and eye detection algorithms and provides a detailed discussion on the recording of study session durations, enabling effective tracking of progress toward predefined goals.
The Study Assistant holds considerable potential for enhancing student engagement, minimizing distractions, and promoting optimal study habits. By offering an innovative and supportive solution, this research contributes significantly to the field of educational technology, ultimately fostering academic success among students.
